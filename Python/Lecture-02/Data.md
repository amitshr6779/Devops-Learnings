## Data Representation in Python
Data can be represented by :
1. Identifier/ Variables/ objects  <br>
* Identifier :  to identify some things
* Variables : value of identifier can vary i.e variables
* objects : vars are only objects
 <br>
 
**NOTE** : variables will have distinct name as we cant namae same name two diffrent variables.  <br>

2. Literal  <br>
* literals are values asigned to variables i.e  input  value apssed to the program

<br>

3. Data Type
* It assigns memory to values i.e literals

<h4> Rules for Naming Variables : </h4>
1. Variables name is combination of  alphabets, numbers, and special char i.e underscore ( _ ) <br>
2. Variables name  must start with alpahabets or unserscore , other than this nothing is allowed. <br>
3. Variables should not have  keyword name i.e for, while etc <br>
4. Variables name can have class name like int, float etc  <br>
5. Variable name are case sensitive <br>

<br> 
<b> Examples </b>

```
my-sal=1000 //error bcz - is not allowed
_$mysal=1000  //error   bcz $ is nnot allowed only unserscore 
mysal=1000
mysal#january=1000   //this is true as after # will be considerd as comment value and mysal is also defined
newsal#jan=10000 // error bcz before # newsal is undefined

```
<br>

## Data Types in Python
It allocate memory to input in the progarm i.e to the values  of variables. <br>
Python is dynamically typed  langiage  so not require to mentioned  data types to the vars. <br>  <br>
There are 14 Data Types classified as 6 Types :
